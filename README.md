# WORMpipe

## This is a worm genome analysis pipeline for:

* Quality control of hifi long reads
* Estimation of major genome features such as size repeatitiveness, heterozygosity 
* De novo genome assembly
* Assesment of assembly metrics
* Assembly contanination interrogation and decontamination
* Assembly gene density assesment

# WORMpipe

### This is a worm genome analysis pipeline for:
	* Quality control of hifi long reads using fastp
	* Assessment of genome repeatitiveness, heterozygosity and coverage using jellyfish
	* De novo genome assembly using either hifiasm of flye
	* Assesment of assembly metrics using quast
	* Assembly contanination assesment using blobtools2 and decontamination
	* Busco analysis
